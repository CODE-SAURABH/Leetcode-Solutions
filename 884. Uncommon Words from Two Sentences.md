# BruteForce Method

```python
class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> List[str]:
        s1 = Counter(s1.split())
        s2 = Counter(s2.split())
        
        uncommon = []
        for s in s1:
            if s1[s] == 1 and s not in s2:
                uncommon.append(s)
        for s in s2:
            if s2[s] == 1 and s not in s1:
                uncommon.append(s)
        
        return uncommon
```

## Optimize Method

```python
class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> List[str]:
        words1 = s1.split()
        words2 = s2.split()
        combined_count = Counter(words1 + words2)
        uncommon = [word for word in combined_count if combined_count[word] == 1]
        return uncommon
```
