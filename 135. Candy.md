# BruteForce Method

```python


class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n  # Initially, give 1 candy to every child

        # Keep iterating until all conditions are satisfied
        stable = False
        while not stable:
            stable = True
            for i in range(n):
                # Check left neighbor
                if i > 0 and ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1] and candies[i] <= candies[i - 1]:
                    candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
                    stable = False

                # Check right neighbor
                if i < n - 1 and ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] and candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]:
                    candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1
                    stable = False

        return sum(candies)

# Optimize Method

```python

class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n

        # Left-to-right pass
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1

        # Right-to-left pass
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)

        return sum(candies)
