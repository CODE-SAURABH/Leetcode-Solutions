# Optimize Method

```python
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy
        current = head
        
        while current and current.next:
            # Nodes to be swapped
            first = current
            second = current.next
            
            # Swapping
            prev.next = second
            first.next = second.next
            second.next = first
            
            # Re-position prev and current for the next pairs
            prev = first
            current = first.next
        
        return dummy.next
