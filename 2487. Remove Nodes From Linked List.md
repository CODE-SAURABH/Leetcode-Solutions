# BruteForce Method

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Reverse the linked list
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node
        head = prev

        # Remove nodes that have a greater value on the right
        max_val = float('-inf')
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        current = dummy

        while current.next:
            if current.next.val >= max_val:
                max_val = current.next.val
                current = current.next
            else:
                current.next = current.next.next

        # Reverse the list back to its original order
        prev = None
        current = dummy.next
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node

        return prev
