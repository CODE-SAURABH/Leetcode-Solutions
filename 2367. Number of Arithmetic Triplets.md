# BruteForce Method

```python
class Solution:
    def arithmeticTriplets(self, nums: List[int], diff: int) -> int:
        c=0
        i=0
        n=len(nums)
        while i<n-2:
            j=i+1
            while j<n-1:
                k=j+1
                while abs(nums[i]-nums[j])==diff and k<n:
                    if nums[k]-nums[j]==diff:
                        c+=1
                    k+=1
                j+=1
            i+=1
        return c
```

## Optimize Method

```python
class Solution:
    def arithmeticTriplets(self, nums: List[int], diff: int) -> int:
       
        seen = set()
        result = 0

        for val in nums:
            if val - diff in seen and (val - 2 * diff) in seen:
                result += 1
            
            seen.add(val)

        return result
```
