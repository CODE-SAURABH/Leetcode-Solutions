# BruteForce Method

```python
class Solution:
    def stringMatching(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        l=[]
        for i in words:
            for j in words:
                if i in j and i!=j and i not in l:
                    l.append(i)

        return l

Time Complexity O(n*n*(m))
where m is the average length of the words.
```

# Optimize Method

```python
class Solution:
    def stringMatching(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Sort words by length
        words.sort(key=len)
        result = []

        for i in range(len(words)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
                if words[i] in words[j]:
                    result.append(words[i])
                    break  # No need to check further once a match is found

        return result

While the time complexity remains similar to the original code in the worst case, the optimized code significantly reduces redundant checks and is faster in practice.
