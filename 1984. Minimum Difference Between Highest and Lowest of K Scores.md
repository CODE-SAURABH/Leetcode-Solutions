# BruteForce Method

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # sort the array in O(NlogN)
        nums = sorted(nums)

        # sweep sliding window of size k O(N)
        min_diff = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(nums)-k+1):
            window = nums[i:i+k]
            diff = max(window) - min(window)
            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)

        return min_diff
```

## Optimize Method

```python


class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if k == 1:
            return 0
        nums.sort()
        
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            diff = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]
            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
        
        return min_diff
```
